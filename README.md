My name is Zanele Hlongwane. I am a student at Brigham Young University-Idaho, studying towards my Information Technology (Bachelor of Science Degree) with a minor in Data Science. I love technology and the great potential it has to make life more easy and convenient. I am always eager to learn and develop my skills in the IT and Data Science fields respectively.
